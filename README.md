# SLCS3_exam
This repository contains implementations and experimental results for different optimization and constraint programming models, along with scripts to generate and analyze performance graphs.

## Repository Structure

```

├── analysis/
├── cp_boolean/
├── cp_integer/
├── ls/
├── qubo/
├── graphs.py
└── README.md
```

### `analysis/`

Contains **PNG files** generated by `graphs.py`. These images typically visualize performance metrics (e.g. runtime comparisons) extracted from the experimental results.

### `cp_boolean/`

Constraint Programming **Boolean** model implementation.

* Model source code
* A `solve_times.txt` file containing timing / performance results

### `cp_integer/`

Constraint Programming **Integer** model implementation.

* Model source code
* A `solve_times.txt` file containing timing / performance results

### `ls/`

Local Search (LS) model implementation.

* Model source code
* A `solve_times.txt` file containing timing / performance results

### `qubo/`

QUBO (Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization) model implementation.

* Model source code
* A `solve_times.txt` file containing timing / performance results

### `graphs.py`

Python script used to:

* Parse the timing/result `.txt` files produced by the different models
* Generate comparative plots
* Save the resulting figures as `.png` files in the `analysis/` folder

## Usage

1. Run the desired model implementation inside one of the model folders (`cp_boolean`, `cp_integer`, `ls`, `qubo`) to generate timing results.
```bash
python graphs.py
```
2. Ensure the output `.txt` files are available to `graphs.py`.
3. Execute:

```bash
python graphs.py
```

4. Generated plots will be saved in the `analysis/` directory.

## Notes

* Each modeling approach is self-contained in its own folder.
* Timing results are stored as plain text for easy inspection and reproducibility.
* The repository is structured to facilitate direct performance comparison across modeling paradigms.
