### `analysis/`

Contains **PNG files** generated by `graphs.py`.

### `cp_boolean/`

Constraint Programming **Boolean** model implementation.

* Model source code `cp_boolean.mzn`
* A `solve_times.txt` file containing (N, solve_time) pairs
* A `result.txt` file containing the MiniZinc outputs for each value of N
* A `statistics_script.py` which runs the MiniZinc program for each value of N and stores the returned data

### `cp_integer/`

Constraint Programming **Integer** model implementation.

* Model source code `cp_integer.mzn`
* A `solve_times.txt` file containing containing (N, solve_time) pairs
* A `result.txt` file containing the MiniZinc outputs for each value of N
* A `statistics_script.py` which runs the MiniZinc program for each value of N and stores the returned data

### `ls/`

Local Search (LS) model implementation.

* Model source code `ls.py`
* A `solve_times.txt` file containing containing (N, solve_time) pairs

### `qubo/`

QUBO (Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization) model implementation.

* Model source code `qubo.py`
* A `solve_times.txt` file containing (N, solve_time) pairs

### `graphs.py`

Python script used to:

* Parse the timing/result `.txt` files produced by the different models
* Generate comparative plots
* Save the resulting figures as `.png` files in the `analysis/` folder

## Usage

1. Run the desired model implementation inside one of the model folders (`cp_boolean`, `cp_integer`, `ls`, `qubo`) to generate timing results.
Model: `cp_boolean`
```bash
python statistics_script.py
```
Model: `cp_integer`
```bash
python statistics_script.py
```
Model: `ls`
```bash
python ls.py
```
Model: `qubo`
```bash
python qubo.py
```
2. Ensure the output `.txt` files are available to `graphs.py`.
3. Execute:

```bash
python graphs.py
```

4. Generated plots are saved in the `analysis/` directory.
